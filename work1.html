          <h3>What?</h3>
          <p>
            This is an stylization of Minnie Mouse. It's created in Adobe
            Illustrator for a school assignment.
          </p>
          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <p>
            The assignment were to make a stylization of something. When making
            a stylization it's important to think of what you need to keep for
            people to understand what it is, and what you can delete. I choose
            to do a stylization of Minnie Mouse because she was in one of my
            favorite shows when I were a kid. The one thing that I thought were
            important for people to understand what character I made a
            stylization of was her bow.
