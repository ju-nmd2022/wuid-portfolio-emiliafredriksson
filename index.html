              My name is Emilia Fredriksson and I'm 19 years old. <br />
              I was born 20 March 2003, in Sweden. <br />
              I moved from Sk√•ne to J√∂nk√∂ping in August 2022. <br />
              Now I'm studing New Media Design at J√∂nk√∂ping University. <br />
        One of my biggest dreams is to become a graphic designer in the future. <br />
        In the same time I want to travel and explore the world.

      <h3>My interests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Working creatively</li>
        <li>Reading books</li>
        <li>Baking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        First of I really like to work creatively in different ways. I draw
        digitally on my iPad, but I also like to work with paper. <br />
        Before moving I used to do a little bit of origami, but since I've moved
        it's been a lot more digital work instead. <br />
        I also really like reading. I spend a lot of my day under a blanket in
        my sofa with a good book in hand. <br />
        When it comes to books I prefer romantic books, but I have also been
        reading reality-based books and some fantasy books. <br />
        Last but not least I really like baking. I did a lot of baking with my
        grandparents as a kid and as I grown up thats an interest thats stayed
        with me. If I get to decide the baking will include either chocolate or licorice or both.

      <h3>New Media Desing</h3>
      <p>
        I choose to read New Media Design on J√∂nk√∂ping Univeristy because of my
        dream about working with graphic design. In Sk√•ne they didn't have any
        program that gave me the same spreed of knowledge as this one. I think
        the final decision to choose this program was the programming because I
        know that today it is a good skill to have as a graphic designer. Before
        I started to study here I had never been in J√∂nk√∂ping before. But now
        after I've been living here for a while I really like the town.
