          <h3>Basic facts</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Emilia Fredriksson and I'm 19 years old. <br />
            I was born 20 March 2003, in Sweden. <br />
            I moved from Sk√•ne to J√∂nk√∂ping in August 2022. <br />
            Now I'm studing New Media Design at J√∂nk√∂ping University. <br />
            One of my biggest dreams is to become a graphic designer in the
            future. <br />
            In the same time I want to travel and explore the world.
          </p>
          <h3>My interests</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Working creatively</li>
            <li>Reading books</li>
            <li>Baking</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            First of I really like to work creatively in different ways. I draw
            digitally on my iPad, but I also like to work with paper. <br />
            Before moving I used to do a little bit of origami, but since I've
            moved it's been a lot more digital work instead. <br />
            I also really like reading. I spend a lot of my day under a blanket
            in my sofa with a good book in hand. <br />
            When it comes to books I prefer romantic books, but I have also been
            reading reality-based books and some fantasy books. <br />
            Last but not least I really like baking. I did a lot of baking with
            my grandparents as a kid and as I grown up thats an interest thats
            stayed with me. If I get to decide the baking will include either
            chocolate or licorice or both.
          </p>
          <h3>New Media Desing</h3>
          <p>
            I choose to read New Media Design on J√∂nk√∂ping Univeristy because of
            my dream about working with graphic design. In Sk√•ne they didn't
            have any program that gave me the same spreed of knowledge as this
            one. I think the final decision to choose this program was the
            programming because I know that today it is a good skill to have as
            a graphic designer. Before I started to study here I had never been
            in J√∂nk√∂ping before. But now after I've been living here for a while
            I really like the town.
