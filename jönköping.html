        <h3>What can you do in J√∂nk√∂ping?</h3>
      <p>
        In the middle of the city there are a street with many stores and a
        couple of restaurants. <br />
        For example there is Akademibokhandeln which is a bookstore, New Yorker
        which is a clothing store and <br />
        Lagerhaus where you can find beautiful things to make your home cozy.
        <br />
        If you have a free day and don't want to do anything to exhausting I
        would recommend going to the centrum and just walk around. <br />
        You decide yourself how far and for how long you want to walk. This
        might be one of my favorite things to do in the city.
      </p>
        If shopping is your thing you can also find the shopping center Asecs
        here. <br />
        It's easy to go there with car or bus, but if you have the energy you
        can take a 40 min walk from the centrum to get there. <br />
      </p>
      <h3>Bars and places to go</h3>

      <h3>Where should I eat?</h3>
      <p>
        In the city there is many restaurants and the best way to find something
        you like is just to walk along the streets and read the diffrenent
        menues and food chooices. <br />
        Two places I have tried and would recommend is Sambosak and Basilika.
        Both of them is placed along the street with all the stores in the
        middle of the city. <br />
        Sambosak is an indonesian restaurant. They have vegetarian alternatives
        so this is a good restaurant whatever food habits you might have. <br />
        They have different Mezas that is smaller portions of food like pots,
        salads and sauces. I would personally say that they have something for
        everybody. <br />
        Basilika is an asian restaurant. This restaurant offers a buffet, but
        you can also just order specific diches to if you don't want the buffet.
        <br />
        In the buffet they have common asian dishes, suchi and of coaurse they
        also offers fruit and dessert. If you're into asian food this is a
        really good choice for you.
