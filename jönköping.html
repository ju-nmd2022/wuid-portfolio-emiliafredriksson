          <h3>What can you do in J√∂nk√∂ping?</h3>
          <p>
            In the middle of the city there are a street with many stores and a
            couple of restaurants. <br />
            For example there is Akademibokhandeln which is a bookstore, New
            Yorker which is a clothing store and <br />
            Lagerhaus where you can find beautiful things to make your home
            cozy.
            <br />
            If you have a free day and don't want to do anything to exhausting I
            would recommend going to the centrum and just walk around. <br />
            You decide yourself how far and for how long you want to walk. This
            might be one of my favorite things to do in the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            If shopping is your thing you can also find the shopping center
            Asecs here. <br />
            It's easy to go there with car or bus, but if you have the energy
            you can take a 40 min walk from the centrum to get there. <br />
            In Asecs you can find a lot of different stores, some cafes and
            places to eat. This is a good place to go on a cold day when you
            don't want to be outside. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are like me and just enjoy taking walks there is good places
            to walk along both V√§ttern and Munksj√∂n. <br />
            The view oven the lakes is amazing and it's very relaxing just
            walking along them. If you get tierd of walking there is benches
            where you can sit, <br />
            relax and just enjoy the view from. This is an activity you can do
            whatever time of the year it is as long as you dress according to
            the weather.
          </p>
          <h3>Bars and places to go</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to bars and places to just meet up with people there
            are probably alot more than I'm aware of. <br />
            The bars I know is close to the bus stop Juneporten. For example
            there is Shooters and H√∂rnan. <br />
            At shooters you can play biljard with your friends and at H√∂rnan you
            can sing kareoke. <br />
            The good thing is that these bars is placed right beside each other
            so you can shift between them if you want to do both.
          </p>
          <h3>Where should I eat?</h3>
          <p>
            In the city there is many restaurants and the best way to find
            something you like is just to walk along the streets and read the
            diffrenent menues and food chooices. <br />
            Two places I have tried and would recommend is Sambosak and
            Basilika. Both of them is placed along the street with all the
            stores in the middle of the city. <br />
            Sambosak is an indonesian restaurant. They have vegetarian
            alternatives so this is a good restaurant whatever food habits you
            might have. <br />
            They have different Mezas that is smaller portions of food like
            pots, salads and sauces. I would personally say that they have
            something for everybody. <br />
            Basilika is an asian restaurant. This restaurant offers a buffet,
            but you can also just order specific diches to if you don't want the
            buffet.
            <br />
            In the buffet they have common asian dishes, suchi and of coaurse
            they also offers fruit and dessert. If you're into asian food this
            is a really good choice for you. <br />
            Of course you can also find less fancy restaurants in the city to if
            you just want something easy like a hamburger.
